# 3dTowerDefenseGame-70-hours

CyDef is a tower defense meets Minecraft game. We were a team of two and created this game from scratch in C++ over the course of two weeks. Our 3D grid system made our game conducive to ai which were programmed to run limited BFS or make context aware movement/attack choices. The Tron-like art style was achieved by implementing the Sobel filter in GLSL.
